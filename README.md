# SpockOnAChip
NeoTrinkey code to deliver random quotes from Mr Spock


* prt.py - provides HID support for prt(TEXT,REPL) - REPL = False sends text to HID, REPL = True prints text to REPL
* spock - batch of quotes from Mr Spock
* spock.py - code; copy to code.py to run. Touch pad 1 or 2 to get a quote

#note
You can edit "spock" file - add your own quotes; they just need to be on a single line so the program can pick them out.
